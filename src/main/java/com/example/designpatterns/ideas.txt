Design patterns
- creational: singleton, builder, factory method, abstract factory, object pool, prototype
- structural: adapter, bridge, composite, decorator, facade, proxy
- behavioral: chain of responsibility, command, interpreter, iterator, observer, strategy, visitor

1. Creational patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. They are further
subdivided into class-creation-patterns or object-creational patterns.

2. Structural patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure, composition and hierarchical
links. The goal of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the classes involved, without
chaning much of its composition.

3. Behavioral patterns are designed to facilitate the communication between multiple classes.
